open squares '.' and trees '#'

write to list of list

data struct: list of lists; each list is list of string

x is position from left to right
y is position from top to bottom

forest height and width.
while y is within height (that 0, 1, 2, forest_width -1)

slope is dx and dy with dx = 3 and dy = 1

indexing forest: outer index is rows; that's y. inner index is columns. that's x.
so indexing goes forest[y][x]

remember to let x loop

part 2

write a function to take a slope and produce a number of trees

then run the function for each of the slops in the problem description
dx=1 and dy=1, dx=3 and dy=1, dx=5 and dy=1, dx=7 and dy=1, dx=1 and dy=2
